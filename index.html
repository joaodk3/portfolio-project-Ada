            <h2> About me </h2> 
            <p> Hi! I'm Ada, Countess of Lovelace and am an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for my work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
            <br>
            <p> I am one of the first to recognize that machines have applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.</p>
            <br>
            <p> In my free time I like to read about scientific developments, mathematics, and computational mathematics. I also like to take my chances of winning big.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Fun fact! I've been programing for 6,507,180,258 seconds! </p>
